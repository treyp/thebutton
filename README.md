# The Button Snitch
Monitor [Reddit](//www.reddit.com/)'s [/r/thebutton](//www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/). A fork of [jamesrom.github.io](//jamesrom.github.io) with different visualizations and notifications. Built using [React](//facebook.github.io/react/) and [D3](//d3js.org).

## To Do List
- [x] Change header stat labels to be clearer
- [x] Port to React
- [x] Make chart horizontal with fixed, user-selectable bar height
- [x] Add desktop notifications when the timer hits a user-defined number
- [x] Get WebSocket URL from Reddit directly instead of hard-coding
- [x] Add chart to display click numbers over time
- [x] Make text labels optional
- [x] Consider adding AM/PM to time labels on X axis
- [x] Change counting of simultaenous clicks so all clickers get the proper flair (instead of 60s for the "missed" presses)
- [x] Show distribution of flair colors in tracked clicks
- [x] Better handling of connection errors/disconnects
- [x] Support beep noise for new clicks (suggestion from [/u/crazykoala](//www.reddit.com/user/crazykoala))
- [x] Update favicon and window title to reflect color and time remaining
- [x] Add a histogram chart (started as [a pull request from renoth](//github.com/treyp/thebutton/pull/1))
- [x] ~~Hide animations when page not visible (for performance reasons)~~ D3 uses requestAnimationFrame which takes care of this
- [x] Throw away data older than X minutes for performance reasons (suggestion from [/u/debugmonkey](//www.reddit.com/user/debugmonkey))
- [x] Add current time to histogram chart (suggestion from [/u/shotgun_nancy](//www.reddit.com/user/shotgun_nancy))
- [x] Fix all the bugs introduced by the data discarding feature (reported by [/u/TOTALLY_ATHIEST](//www.reddit.com/user/TOTALLY_ATHIEST))
- [x] Add a new darker theme called night mode (suggestion from [/u/SohnoJam](//www.reddit.com/user/SohnoJam))
- [x] Import historical data on first load
- [x] Replay functionality (started as [a pull request from jmlsteele](//github.com/treyp/thebutton/pull/5))
- [x] Show time zone on time axes
- [ ] Bug fix: delayed clicks (bump in participant count between resets) count as their own time instead of either adding to the previous reset (desired behavior) or going to the next reset (not desirable, but at least the total number of seconds would be correct) (bug noticed by [/u/attilad](//www.reddit.com/user/attilad))
- [ ] Better X axis ticks for time chart (show beginning, end, some middle) (suggestion from [/u/EyeAmmonia](//www.reddit.com/user/EyeAmmonia))
- [ ] Dual chart display (request from [/u/argash](//www.reddit.com/user/argash))
- [ ] Breakdown of percentage of time spent in each color (request from [/u/carpevirginem](//www.reddit.com/user/carpevirginem))
- [ ] Beep support like Squire
- [ ] Scroll to zoom, or at least support clamping to start/end times selectable in options bar
- [ ] Horizontal option for log chart
- [ ] Export graph to an image
- [ ] Make header responsive
- [ ] Replace pulse dot with a clearer "live" text that fades out after 1 second (with a 1 second fade)
- [ ] Auto dot size and bar height option: starts large, shrinks down based on window size, minimum of 1
- [ ] Add pause button
- [ ] Cookie to save settings
